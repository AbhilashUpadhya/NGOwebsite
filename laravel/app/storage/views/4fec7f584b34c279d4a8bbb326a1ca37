						The Lazarus Effect film tells the stories of 4 HIV+ people in Zambia, including Concillia Muhua who when we first meet her is close to death’s door. 
						The film shows her incredible transformation after 90 days of taking ARV treatment – this transformation is called “The Lazarus Effect.” As Concillia puts it: “There was nothing I could do for myself. I could not feed myself properly. I could not look after my daughter. After I started medication it was like I was resurrected.”

						Run If Forward (RIF) brings awareness and focus to some of the America’s most underserved schools. With great need along the most historic highway, Route 66, every step of the highway is covered by a pounding of the pavement by a runner. Each step is a stride towards a better tomorrow.

The Main Street of America becomes the classroom where education and academics meets endurance athletes running it forward. Knowing the greatest reward is not a payback but a pay it forward, a small group of ‘soccer moms’ of action are passionate about the plight of education for today’s children.</div>
